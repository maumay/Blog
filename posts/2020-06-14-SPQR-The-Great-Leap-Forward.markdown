#### Introduction

This post attempts to summarise chapter 4 of the book 'SPQR' written by Mary Beard. The aim is not to copy verbatim but to try and get down my own interpretation of the main bits I found interesting so as to cement the knowledge more firmly into my grey matter. All citations come from here and the page number of the quote will be given immediately after it is presented.

The time period covered is the murky yet extremely important period in the history of the Roman people where the transition from the preceeding (even murkier) period of monarchical governance to the more familiar political structure of a democratic republic took place. Spread over roughly 300 years from 500-200BCE we look at the changes to the concept of citizenship and rights granted therein alongside the first codified laws and the initialisation of the unstoppable military machine that would extend far and wide over the coming centuries.

Later Roman historians often liked to paint a neat picture of a timeline of events throughout Roman history and this was no exception. Clearly a great deal of embellishment went on in the claim that the position of consul could be traced back man by man to the end of the monarchy in around 509BCE when Tarquin fled the city. The first actual recorded mention of the word consul (or consol as written in its archaic form) was found on .... tomb of Scipio long beard. Maybe quote inscription. [131-135]

Differences between the time of the Tarquin ~500BCE and Scipio longbeard ~? [135-136] at some point in the intervening years a dramatic shift happened transforming the city from fairly unremarkable into the precursor of one of the greatest civilizations in human history.

The tenuousness of the links and the tantalizing nature of knowledge at the very edge of the paper trail. One of the most insightful and valubale resources we have are the '12 tables' which are a collection of around 80 or so laws dating from about ?

#### The Twelve Tables

The original bronze tablets onto which about 80 rules/laws/regulations were engraved are unfortunately lost to us and the only way we know of theur existence is through independent writings which have survived the years capturing various msnippets which have been painstakingly pieced together over cenmturies of scholarly detective work.There are endless technical discussions about the meaning and the quality of translation. Evidently something of the original meaning has been lost through
interpretation and translation - or at least one would hope - (quote about creditors dividing up debtor). 

From a modern perspective the wording is crude and lacking the logical clarity we take for granted in contractual legalese and clearly shows a more simplistic society in its infancy however the mere fact of existence sets it apart from most societies throughout antiquity. [142 - 143] 

Evidence for the societal hierarchy is also present with different punishments set out for different 'tiers' of wrongdoing which depended on the status of the offender and the offendee. For example assulting a slave was punished half as severely as assult on a free man. We see distinctions in the ranks of free men too, between so called 'patricians' and 'plebians' etc etc

The twelve tables give no evidence that Rome had evolved beyond the point of an average size agricultural town which had some basic distinctions in its social hierarchy and which had made a rudimentary attempt to encode rules to follow when small scale infractions happened between individuals whther that relates to physical violence, theft or other property issues. There is no indication at this point of what Rome was to become. What they had done was uncommon but unremarkable, ancient
Hammurabi of Babylon had encoded laws about 1000 years earlier!


#### Outline

Main topics covered are

2. The first known Roman laws which were encoded on the 12 Bronze statues

1. The changes in citizenship from two distinct classes of ruling patricians and ruled plebians to a equalised idea of a Roman citizen
   * Something else

3. The shift in military dominance in the region from contender to dominance

4. Emphasis of the murkiness of looking back at the period, so many unknowns!


Can 1 and 3 be done separately or are they inseparably intertwined?
